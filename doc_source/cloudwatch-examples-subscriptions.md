# Using subscription filters in Amazon CloudWatch Logs<a name="cloudwatch-examples-subscriptions"></a>

![\[JavaScript code example that applies to Node.js execution\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/images/nodeicon.png)

**This Node\.js code example shows:**
+ How to create and delete filters for log events in CloudWatch Logs\.

## The scenario<a name="cloudwatch-examples-subscriptions-scenario"></a>

Subscriptions provide access to a real\-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs and deliver that feed to other services, such as an Amazon Kinesis stream or AWS Lambda, for custom processing, analysis, or loading to other systems\. A subscription filter defines the pattern to use for filtering which log events are delivered to your AWS resource\.

In this example, a series of Node\.js modules are used to list, create, and delete a subscription filter in CloudWatch Logs\. The destination for the log events is a Lambda function\. The Node\.js modules use the SDK for JavaScript to manage subscription filters using these methods of the `CloudWatchLogs` client class:

+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-cloudwatch-logs/classes/describesubscriptionfiltercommand.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-cloudwatch-logs/classes/describesubscriptionfiltercommand.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-cloudwatch-logs/classes/deletesubscriptionfiltercommand.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/clients/client-cloudwatch-logs/classes/deletesubscriptionfiltercommand.html)

For more information about CloudWatch Logs subscriptions, see [Real\-time processing of log data with subscriptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/Subscriptions.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\.

## Prerequisite tasks<a name="cloudwatch-examples-subscriptions-prerequisites"></a>

To set up and run this example, you must first complete these tasks:
+ Set up the project environment to run these Node TypeScript examples, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third\-party modules\. Follow the instructions on[ GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javascriptv3/example_code/cloudwatch-logs/README.md)\.
+ Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials\. For more information about providing a shared credentials file, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\.
+ Create an AWS Lambda function as the destination for log events\. You will need to use the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of this function\. For more information about setting up a Lambda function, see [Subscription filters with Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/SubscriptionFilters.html#LambdaFunctionExample) in the *Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide*\.
+ Create an IAM role whose policy grants permission to invoke the Lambda function you created and grants full access to CloudWatch Logs or apply the following policy to the execution role you create for the Lambda function\. For more information about creating an IAM role, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Use the following role policy when creating the IAM role\.

```
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "logs:CrateLogStream",
            "logs:PutLogEvents"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
      },
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
            "lambda:InvokeFunction"
         ],
         "Resource": [
            "*"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

**Important**  
These examples demonstrate how to import/export client service objects and command using ECMAScript6 \(ES6\)\.  
This requires Node\.js version 13\.x or higher\. To download and install the latest version of Node\.js, see [Node\.js downloads\.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)\.
If you prefer to use CommonJS syntax, see [JavaScript ES6/CommonJS syntax](sdk-example-javascript-syntax.md)\.

## Describing existing subscription filters<a name="cloudwatch-examples-subscriptions-describing"></a>

Create a `libs` directory, and create a Node\.js module with the file name `cloudWatchLogsClient.js`\. Copy and paste the code below into it, which creates the CloudWatch Logs client object\. Replace *REGION* with your AWS region\.

```
import { CloudWatchLogsClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs";
// Set the AWS Region.
const REGION = "REGION"; //e.g. "us-east-1"
// Create an Amazon CloudWatch Logs service client object.
export const cwlClient = new CloudWatchLogsClient({ region: REGION });
```

This code is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/master/javascriptv3/example_code/cloudwatch-logs/src/libs/cloudWatchLogsClient.js)\.

Create a Node\.js module with the file name `describeSubscriptionFilters.js`\. Be sure to configure the SDK as previously shown, including downloading the CloudWatch client\. Create a JSON object containing the parameters needed to describe your existing filters, including the name of the log group and the maximum number of filters to describe\. Call the `DescribeSubscriptionFiltersCommand` method\.

**Note**  
Replace *GROUP\_NAME* with the name of the group\.

```
// Import required AWS SDK clients and commands for Node.js
import { DescribeSubscriptionFiltersCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs";
import { cwlClient } from "./libs/cloudWatchLogsClient.js";

// Set the parameters
export const params = {
  logGroupName: "GROUP_NAME", //GROUP_NAME
  limit: 5
};

export const run = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await cwlClient.send(
      new DescribeSubscriptionFiltersCommand(params)
    );
    console.log("Success", data.subscriptionFilters);
    return data; // For unit tests.
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error", err);
  }
};
// Uncomment this line to run execution within this file.
// run();
```

To run the example, enter the following at the command prompt\.

```
node describeSubscriptionFilters.js
```
